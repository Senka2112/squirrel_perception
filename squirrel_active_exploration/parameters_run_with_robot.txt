run_robot_experiment.launch parameters

  * save_directory: the directory to save all data (point clouds, probabilities and results)
  * map_locations_file: the file that stores the absolute locations of the candidate viewpoints
  * store_points_directory: the directory to store the point cloud files captured from the sensor (stored as .pcd)
  * image_file: a necassary file for calling the segmentation algorithm
  * variance: the sigma value for exponential factor in the utility function (see Patten et al.)
  * plan_type: sets the planning mode (the options are worst_to_best_entropy, best_to_worst_entropy, worst_to_best_probability,
best_to_worst_probability, nearest_location_area, nearest_location_min_entropy, nearest_location_max_probability, random, max_area,
max_area_unoccluded, min_class_entropy, min_class_entropy_unoccluded, max_class_probability, max_class_probability_unoccluded,
min_view_classification_entropy, max_view_classification_probability, clockwise, anticlockwise)
  * expected_number_objects: the number of objects in the scene (Willow Garage dataset all have 6 objects)
  * expected_number_classes: the number of classes that were used for training (this and the previous parameter are only important when
computing the entropy of unseen objects, these can be ignored of that is not important)
  * scene_center_x: the x location of the center of the scene, required in order to focus the gaze of the robot when viewing the objects
  * scene_center_y: the y location of the center of the scene
  * kinect_height: the height of the sensor on the robot, relative to the floor
  * visualize: boolean flag to view the intermediate steps of the algorithm (the user must then interact in order to move onto next stages)
  * save*: boolean flag to save results data
  * max_object_distance: after segmentation, remove objects further away than this distance (helpful to ignore walls, etc)
  * min_object_height: after segmentation, remove objects that have a height less than this value
  * max_object_height: after segmentation, remove objects that have a height greater than this value
  * min_object_length: after segmentation, remove objects that have a length less than this value
  * max_object_lenght: after segmentation, remove objects that have a length greater than this value
  * table_height_threshold: after segmentation, remove objects that have a centroid below the table height (not used)
  * voxel_overlap: the amount of overlap between segments in different frames to be considered the same object (see Patten et al.)
